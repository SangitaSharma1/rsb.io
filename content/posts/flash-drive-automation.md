Today I flashed over 120 USB sticks for [IGIC] [1] conference happening at the
Strong campus in Rochester. At first the task seemed daunting, but a [quick
script] [2] solved the problem of manual copying pretty handily, and a powered
USB hub made it posssible to write to 9 drives at a time. Bash swoops in to
provide a handy solution yet again.
