This weekend the [FOSSBox][1] sent a team to [Hack Upstate][2], which drew
attendees from upwards of 300 miles away. It was a very different feel than a
lot of hackathons in Rochester, much more business- and design-type folks. Our
team felt a little out of place as nearly pure programmers. This was pretty
apparent during the pitches, which included farmers market awareness apps and
WYSIWYG Wordpress plugin builders.

Our project is called [panstora] and it's designed to provide a more online
interface to physical stores. It's built on [Pyramid][4] and [SQLAlchemy][5].
Users are supposed to use the app in stores to view more info about the item
and to have the item delivered to them the same day, instead of buying items
and carrying them home.

This would be good for clothing stores by allowing them to hold less stock in
store, letting them compete with online-level variety and increase the amount
of floor space in their store. This would save the store money, and make it
more attractive to consumers since more variety would be available.

THe app is in a demoable state right now, even though the demos aren't until
10am today. Unfortunately, the venue had to close for the night at midnight,
leaving our team to wander the streets of Syracuse. We've set ourselves up at a
Denny's and are working from there, and after that we'll either work in our
cars or something. As a note to future hackathon organizers, having a 24 hour
venue is definitely crucial.

Also, I'd like to give a huge shoutout to [iron.io][5], who [sent][6] one of their
employees, [Patty Foran][7]. He spent a good chunk of the time there just
hanging out and chatting about FOSS, [Golang][8]. It was pretty interesting,
even if it did hamper productivity slightly. We still got a demoable app out
the door and I learned a ton about SQLAlchemy relationships.

I'd consider Hack Upstate a great success for FOSS@RIT and I'm already looking
forward to the [NASA Space Apps Challenge][9] on the 20th.
