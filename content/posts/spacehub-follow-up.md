Today is the day. It's the deadline for [Space Apps Challenge][1] project
submissions, and [SpaceHub][2] has a video submitted. Some of our wonderful
colleagues at the [FOSSBox][3] helped us build a logo.

Our project is a way to bring together disparate codebases on Github. The
challenge in question was to take all the different projects NASA has scattered
across BitBucket, private Mercurial repos, SVN repos, and *shudder* tarballs
and centralize them on Github.

This brings the efforts of NASA into the public eye on Github, as well as
making them more discoverable for people who may be looking for a solution to a
problem NASA has solved.
