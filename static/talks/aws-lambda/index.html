# No server is simpler than no server at all

---

# Use Cases

* API backends (mobile, web, IoT)
* Microservices with API Gateway
* On-demand workers
* Data pipelines with S3, DynamoDB, and Kinesis
* Build smarter infrastructure

Critically, you never pay for idle time

# How it Works

Events come in, code executes on the event

```
{
  "Records": [
    {
      "eventVersion": "2.0",
      "eventTime": "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "s3": {
        "configurationId": "testConfigRule",
        "object": {
          "eTag": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
          "sequencer": "0A1B2C3D4E5F678901",
          "key": "HappyFace.jpg",
          "size": 1024
        },
        "bucket": {"arn": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket", "name": "sourcebucket"},
        "s3SchemaVersion": "1.0"
      },
      "awsRegion": "us-east-1",
      "eventName": "ObjectCreated:Put",
      "eventSource": "aws:s3"
    }
  ]
}
```
