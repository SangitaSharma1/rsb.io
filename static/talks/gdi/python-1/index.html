  We're going to start with drawing things as a way to teach you programming concepts.

# Rules of the Road

.large[
1. Every question is important
1. Help each other
1. Ask for help
1. .red[Have fun!]

# Learning to program

1. Lots of very helpful people from the internet (StackOverflow, mailing lists, IRC)
1. Patience, patience, patience
1. Pick it back up again the next day

# Programming

"The *craft* of programming begins with empathy, not formatting or languages or tools or algorithms or data structures" - Kent Beck

# Installing Python

.large[http://continuum.io/downloads]

1. Download Python for your operating system
1. .red[Make sure to download version 3.4]
1. Click on the installer after it's downloaded to install

# Day 1: Drawing with Turtles

Let's open IDLE

# The shell is an interpreter

You say something, the computer translates your idea and responds

Interpreter is great for testing things out, but scripts can be rerun, tweaked, and run again.

# Play time - 10 minutes

1. Ask questions
1. Add a movement
1. Change some numbers
1. Print your name
1. Help your neighbor

  Draw a square

  Draw a pentagon

# One way to draw a pentagon

```

# Loops go around and around

---
class: middle

# Print three "programs"

```
for num in [1, 2, 3]:
    print("program", num)
```

---
class: middle

# It's hip to be square

```
alex = turtle.Turtle()
for side in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
    alex.forward(100)
    alex.left(90)

class: middle

# Shortcut: range

```
alex = turtle.Turtle()
for side in range(5):
    alex.forward(100)
    alex.left(72)
```

`range(5)` and `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` are identical

class: middle

# Add a side!

Now let's try to draw a hexagon

---
class: middle

# Math class reminder

(5 + 3) * 2

5 + 3 * 2

---
class: middle

# Draw your hexagon

How much did you have to change?

---
class: middle

# Can we do better?

Every shape's angles add up to 360 degrees

We only have to write the angle once, and the number of sides

---
class: middle

```
for side in range(number_of_sides):
    alex.forward(100)
    alex.left(angle)
```

---
class: middle

```
number_of_sides = <something>
angle = <something>
for side in range(number_of_sides):
    alex.forward(100)
    alex.left(angle)
```

---
class: middle

```
number_of_sides = 6
angle = 360 / 6
for side in range(number_of_sides):
    alex.forward(100)
    alex.left(angle)
```

---
class: middle

```
number_of_sides = 6
angle = 360 / number_of_sides
for side in range(number_of_sides):
    alex.forward(100)
    alex.left(angle)
```

---
class: middle

# Now an octagon

```
number_of_sides = 8
angle = 360 / number_of_sides
for side in range(number_of_sides):
    alex.forward(100)
    alex.left(angle)
```

We just needed to change the *value* of the variable

# Activity time

Let's learn to do more with turtle.

.large[Google "python turtle 3.4"]

---
class: middle center

# 15 minutes

.large[Teach yourself as many new features as you want]

When your neighbor pauses, share your new function with them

---
class: middle

# Try these

`alex.shape("turtle")`

`alex.down()`

`alex.up()`

`alex.backward(someNumber)`

`alex.color("red")`

`alex.circle(someNumber)`

`alex.stamp()`

---

# What happens here

```
for color_now in ["red", "blue", "yellow", "purple", "green"]:

# Challenges

Draw a star

Draw a spiral

Draw two squares

---
class: middle

# True or False

Just like an exam question. You ask "Is a dog a chicken?" and Python answers

```
>>> "dog" == "chicken"
False
```

```
>>> "dog" == "dog"
True
```

---
class: middle

# Decisions in Code

`True` and `False` can be used to make decisions

```
if animal == "dog":
    print("Woof")
else:
    print("Some other sound")
```

---
class: middle

```
if animal == "dog":
    print("Woof")
elif animal == "cat":
    print("Meow")
elif animal == "cow":
    print("Moo")
else:
    print("Some other sound")
```

---
class: middle

```
for num in range(5):
    if num % 2:
        alex.color("green")
    else:
        alex.color("red")
    alex.forward(100)
    alex.left(72)
```

# Recyling your code

You may notice, a lot of the code we've written has similarities

- Changing values
- Repeating things
- Sharing code with others

---
class: middle center

# Share functionality by defining functions

---
class: middle

# Simple function

```
def drawSquare():
    for num in range(4):
        alex.forward(100)
        alex.left(90)

drawSquare()
alex.up()
alex.forward(200)
alex.down()
drawSquare()
```
---
class: middle

# More options

```
def drawSquare(side):
    for num in range(4):
        alex.forward(side)
        alex.left(90)
drawSquare(100)
drawSquare(200)
drawSquare(300)
```
