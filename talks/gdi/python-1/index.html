# Learning to program

1. Lots of very helpful people from the internet (StackOverflow, mailing lists, IRC)
1. Patience, patience, patience
1. Pick it back up again the next day

# Day 1: Drawing with Turtles

Let's open IDLE

# Loops go around and around

# Print three "programs"

# Shortcut: range

```

for side in range(5):

`range(5)` and `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` are identical

# Add a side!

Now let's try to draw a hexagon

# Draw your hexagon

How much did you have to change?

---

# Can we do better?

Every shape's angles add up to 360 degrees

We only have to write the angle once, and the number of sides

---
class: middle

```
for side in range(number_of_sides):
    alex.forward(100)
    alex.left(angle)
```

---
class: middle

```
number_of_sides = <something>
angle = <something>
for side in range(number_of_sides):
    alex.forward(100)
    alex.left(angle)
```

---
class: middle

```
number_of_sides = 6
angle = 360 / 6
for side in range(number_of_sides):
    alex.forward(100)
    alex.left(angle)
```

---
class: middle

```
number_of_sides = 6
angle = 360 / number_of_sides
for side in range(number_of_sides):
    alex.forward(100)
    alex.left(angle)
```

---
class: middle

# Now an octagon

```
number_of_sides = 8
angle = 360 / number_of_sides
for side in range(number_of_sides):
    alex.forward(100)
    alex.left(angle)
```

We just needed to change the *value* of the variable
