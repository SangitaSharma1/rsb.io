# Quick Review

---
class: middle

Assign a variable?
---
class: middle

Perform an action multiple times?
---
class: middle

Why does indentation matter?

What's a block?
---
class: middle

Define a function?

Call a function?

---
class: middle

What's an argument? How do you set a default?

---
class: middle

Ok, so you know what the interpreter is for and what a script is.

Now how do I solve big problems?

---
class: middle

# We'll get to that

You'll need more tools! Python has classes to help represent more complex problems (and solutions).

Before we can tackle classes, let's lay a bit more groundwork

---
class: middle

# Mathematical Operators

.medium[
`+`

`-`

`/`

`//`

`*`

`**`

`%`
]

---
class: middle

# Mathematical Operators

.medium[
`+` addition

`-` subtraction

`/` division

`//`

`*` multiplication

`**`

`%` modulus
]

---
class: middle

```
>>> 5/2
2.5

>>> 5//2
2
```

---
class: middle

.large[`==`]

```
if 2 == 3:
    print("Math is really broken right now. Try later.")
else:
    pass
```

---
class: middle

# Comparison Operators

`in`

`==`

`!=`

`<=`

`>=`

---
class: middle

# Break

Try the comparison operators we've learned so far

---
class: middle

# Types

Data in Python carries information about itself and is stored differently

```
if "0" == 0:
    print("Hrm...type coercion")
else:
    print("Ok")
```

Why does this code print "Ok"?

---
class: middle

# Find the type

Python can tell you what something is!

```
>>> type(0)
<class 'int'>
```

Now try with some other data!

- 0.0
- 0x13
- "Hello"
- 'h'
- """h"""

---
class: middle

# Strings

A string is a series of stored characters.

You've been using them already in Turtle for colors!

String tips:

`"hello" + "there"`

`"hello" + " there"`

`"hello" * 10`

`print("hello\n" * 10)`

```
for letter in "hello":
    print(letter)
```

```
"Hello {}, how are you".format("Alex")
```
---
class: middle

# But wait

```
>>> "hello" * 10
hellohellohellohellohellohellohellohellohellohello
>>> "hello" + 10
```

.red[```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly"</stdin>"
```]

`type(10)`

`type(str(10))`

---
class: middle

# Fixing type errors

```
"Hello " + str(10)
```

---
class: middle

# Lists

```
>>> shopping = ["milk", "eggs"]
>>> shopping[0]
```

A list is a collection of items of any type you like (yes, including other lists).

You can also modify and combine lists!

How do you think you do that?

---
class: middle

# More About Lists

.red[```
>>> shopping + "bread"
```]

```
>>> shopping + ["bread"]
["milk", "eggs", "bread"]
>>> print(shopping)
["milk", "eggs"]

>>> shopping.append("bread")
>>> print(shopping)
["milk", "eggs", "bread"]
```

```
>>> shopping.remove("eggs")
>>> print(shopping)
["milk", "bread"]
>>> shopping.remove("popsicles")
```

---
class: middle

# Conditionals with lists

```
>>> if "bread" in shopping:
>>>     print("We need bread!")
```
