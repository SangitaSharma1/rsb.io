# Quick Review

---
class: middle

Assign a variable?
---
class: middle

Perform an action multiple times?
---
class: middle

Why does indentation matter?

What's a block?
---
class: middle

Define a function?

Call a function?

---
class: middle

What's an argument? How do you set a default?

---
class: middle

Ok, so you know what the interpreter is for and what a script is.

Now how do I solve big problems?

---
class: middle

# We'll get to that

You'll need more tools! Python has classes to help represent more complex problems (and solutions).

Before we can tackle classes, let's lay a bit more groundwork

---
class: middle

# Mathematical Operators

.medium[
`+`

`-`

`/`

`//`

`*`

`**`

`%`
]

---
class: middle

# Mathematical Operators

.medium[
`+` addition

`-` subtraction

`/` division

`//`

`*` multiplication

`**`

`%` modulus
]

---
class: middle

```
>>> 5/2
2.5

>>> 5//2
2
```

---
class: middle

.large[`==`]

```
if 2 == 3:
    print("Math is really broken right now. Try later.")
else:
    pass
```

---
class: middle

# Comparison Operators

`in`

`is`

`==`

`!=`

`<=`

`>=`

---
class: middle

# Break

Try the comparison operators we've learned so far

---
class: middle

# Types

Data in Python carries information about itself and is stored differently

```
if "0" == 0:
    print("Hrm...type coercion")
else:
    print("Ok")
```

Why does this code print "Ok"?

---
class: middle

# Find the type

Python can tell you what something is!

```
>>> type(0)
<class 'int'>
```

Now try with some other data!

- 0.0
- 0x13
- "Hello"
- 'h'
- """h"""
- None

---
class: middle

# None is special

`NoneType`

---
class: middle

# Strings

A string is a series of stored characters.

You've been using them already in Turtle for colors!

String tips:

`"hello" + "there"`

`"hello" + " there"`

`"hello" * 10`

`print("hello\n" * 10)`

```
for letter in "hello":
    print(letter)
```

```
"Hello {}, how are you".format("Alex")
```
---
class: middle

# But wait

```
>>> "hello" * 10
hellohellohellohellohellohellohellohellohellohello
>>> "hello" + 10
```

.red[```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly"</stdin>"
```]

`type(10)`

`type(str(10))`

---
class: middle

# Fixing type errors

```
"Hello " + str(10)
```

---
class: middle

# Lists

```
>>> shopping = ["milk", "eggs"]
>>> shopping[0]
```

A list is a collection of items of any type you like (yes, including other lists).

You can also modify and combine lists!

How do you think you do that?

---
class: middle

# More About Lists

.red[```
>>> shopping + "bread"
```]

```
>>> shopping + ["bread"]
["milk", "eggs", "bread"]
>>> print(shopping)
["milk", "eggs"]

>>> shopping.append("bread")
>>> print(shopping)
["milk", "eggs", "bread"]
```

```
>>> shopping.remove("eggs")
>>> print(shopping)
["milk", "bread"]
>>> shopping.remove("popsicles")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list"
```

---
class: middle

# Changing list items

```
>>> shopping[0]
milk
>>> shopping[0] = "skim milk"
>>> shopping[0]
skim milk
```

---
class: middle

# Conditionals with lists

```
>>> if "bread" in shopping:
>>>     print("We need bread!")
```

Testing membership

---
class: middle

# Specific Items

Lists always maintain their order, and you can get members of the list with sqare-brackets

```
>>> shopping[0]
"milk"
>>> shopping[10]
```
.red[```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
```]

If you go off the end of a list, you'll get an error

.red[Numbering starts at 0!]

---
class: middle

# Challenge: Make a list of lists!

---
class: middle

# Hip to be Square

Well...polygon...

```
>>> square = [
    [1, 1],
    [1, 2],
    [2, 1],
    [2, 2],
  ]
```

```
>>> for corner in square:
>>>     print corner
```

---
class: middle

# Nested lists, nested loops

```
# Outer loop
>>> for corner in square:
        # Inner loop
>>>     for point in corner:
>>>         print(point)
>>>     print(corner)

# Parameter unpacking
>>> for x, y in square:
>>>     print("X: {}, Y: {}".format(x, y))
```

---
class: middle

# Quick aside: unpacking assignments

```
x, y = 1, 2
```

---
class: middle

# Tuples

```
>>> my_tup = (1, 2, 3)
>>> my_tup[1]
2
>>> my_tup[1] = 99
```
.red[```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment"
```]

---
class: middle

Tuples cannot have their members changed

.medium[When might this be useful?]
---
class: middle

# Challenge: remember our list of lists?

Make a:

- tuple of tuples
- list of tuples
- tuple of lists

.footnote[Challenge: Can you change the members of a list in a tuple?]

---
class: middle

# Dictionaries - a.k.a. maps

A dictionary is a mapping of a key to a value

The keys are *always* unique

Dictionaries do *not* have a defined order like lists and tuples

---
class: middle

```
>>> phone_book = {
    "Alex": "555-5555",
    "Sam": "999-9999",
    "Cory": "111-1111",
}
>>> phone_book["Alex"]
555-5555
```

---
class: middle

# Challenge: Edit Sam's phone number
---
class: middle

# Using a dictionary
```
>>> phone_book["Sam"] = "888-8888"
>>> phone_book.pop("Sam")
888-8888
>>> phone_book.update(
    {
        "Chris": "222-2222"
    }
)

>>> phone_book.keys()
>>> phone_book.values()
>>> phone_book.items()
```

---
class: middle

# Looping with dictionaries

```
>>> for key, data in phone_book.items()
>>>     print("{} : {}".format(key, data))
```

---
class: middle

# Getting Help

We've seen lots of great builtin stuff for dictionaries, but how would we find more?

---
class: middle

# Getting Help

`help(dict)`

Google "Python 3 dictionary documentation"

Go straight to https://docs.python.org/3/

Ask your neighbor (doesn't always work)

---
class: middle

# Exceptional Cases

So far, we've seen things like TypeError and it's meant we did something wrong. You can handle those errors yourself!

---
class: middle

# Catching Exceptions

Try to do .red[thing] but if that doesn't work, do .red[something else].

```
>>> phone_book["Pat"]
KeyError
>>> try:
        phone_book["Pat"]
    except KeyError:
        print("Pat isn't in the phone book!")
```

---
class: middle

# Great!

Stretch break, 15 minutes

class: middle

# What is a function?

---
class: middle

# Fast review

```
def print_phone_book(book=None):
    if book is None:
        print("No numbers!")
        return
    for k, v in book.items():
        print("{}'s number is {}".format(k, v))
```

---
class: middle

# Functions

Take data, do a thing, return data

---
class: middle

# Objects

Objects are the "nouns" we've been working with already

```
>>> import turtle
>>> type(turtle.Turtle)
>>> <class 'type'>
>>> type(turtle.Turtle())
>>> <class 'turtle.Turtle'>
```

# Objects as cookies

## Classes as cookie cutters

---
class: middle

# Why

What kinds of things do classes make easier?

.large[Reasoning]

---
class: middle

# Let's make a store!

- Keep an inventory of items
- Customers have to be able to buy stuff

---
class: middle

# Start a new file

.medium[`store.py`]

```
class Store:
    def __init__
```

---
class: middle

# `__init__`

Special setup *method*. So what's that mean?

```
    def __init__(self, ....):
        self.name = "Wegman's"
```

A method is a function, but the first argument is `self` (the object).

Methods are attached to objects.

---
class: middle

```
class Store:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def welcome():
        print("Welcome to {}".format(self.name))
```

---
class: middle

# Make an instance of our class

```
class Store:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def welcome():
        print("Welcome to {}".format(self.name))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    wegmans = Store("Wegman's")
    print(type(wegmans))
    wegmans.welcome()
    print(wegmans.name)
```

---
class: middle

Methods can persist state without needing you to pass arguments every time.

State can be saved on the object.

---
class: middle

# Now we need an inventory

What would be a good way to keep prices for every item?
---
class: middle

```
class Store:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.inventory = {}

    def welcome():
        print("Welcome to {}".format(self.name))

    def add_item(name, price):
        self.inventory[name] = price

    def remove_item(name):
        if name in self.inventory.keys():
            self.inventory.pop(name)
        else:
            print("Item {} not in store".format(name))
```

# Quick aside

How do you write a program?

- Think
- Write a little code
- Test it
- Repeat

## Tips:

- Break the big problem into smaller problems
- Choose an approach that makes your life easier
- If you have no idea, try to find an example and explain it to yourself

---
class: middle

# Debugging

- Read the error message, sometimes they'll tell you exactly what went wrong. Sometimes they aren't so helpful.
- Find the line that caused the error and read the code around it. .red[Be vigilant for typos]
- Comment out the code that you think is causing the problem one line at a time
- Print the values of variables where the problem happens
- Print the `type()` of variables, are they what you expected?
- Explain to your monitor (or rubber duck) why the problem *can't possibly be happening*. This works more than you'd think.

---
class: middle

# Assert Statements

```
>>> assert 2 == 3
```

.red[```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AssertionError
```]

Great for debugging and for keeping in your code to make sure the world is the way you thought.

---
class: middle

# Naming Things

- Descriptive
- Memorable
- Easy to type
- Intuitive to someone other than you (including you a week from now)

---
class: middle

# Moving Ahead

Ok, that's the end of preset examples.

Now we're going to add features and I'm going to follow along on screen.

---
class: middle

# Feature ideas

- Purchase items by specifying items and quantities
- Make it easier to debug by adding a way to toggle print statements on and off
- Check if a store has something
- Keep track of how many of each item a store has (we have price information, now we need quantity information)
- Make your class show documentation when someone runs `help(Store)`

---
class: middle

# Challenge

- Read inventory from a file
  - sample at http://rsb.io/talks/gdi/python-2/inventory.csv

---
class: middle

# Reading Files

```
with open("file.txt") as the_data:
    line_number = 1
    for line in the_data.readlines():
        print("Line {}: {}".format(line_number, line))
        line_number += 1
```

---
class: middle

# Writing Files

```
with open("file.txt", 'w') as the_data:
    the_data.write("Hello")
    the_data.write("This is a file")
```
