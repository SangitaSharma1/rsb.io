# workflows

* integration manager: one 'integration manager' is the only person with commit access to a 'blessed' repo
* dictator + lieutenants: great for massive projects (*cough* linuxkernel *cough*) where people are given responsibility for a subsystem ('lieutenants') and pass merged changes to the dictator to be finally commited
