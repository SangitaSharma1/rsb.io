## The seeds of courseware
  - There should be FOSS for teaching classes on FOSS
  - Github Native courseware. Homework? No, pull requests.

---

## Version 1
  - Flask
  - YAML
  - Single repo
  - OpenShift

---

## Students
  - Make pull requests
  - Can fix bugs
  - Hands-on with FOSS

---

## Curse of success
  - More ...
  - courses
  - students
  - content
  - bugfixes
  - porting bugfixes :(

---

## The next generation
  - Available on PyPi
  - Repo per course
  - TravisCI validates YAML

---

## Magic OpenShift
  - Hide complexity
  - Add Openshift boilerplate
  - Make a scratch commit
  - push it

---

## The future
